# Singly Linked Lists

The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of linked lists, pointers, referencing, dereferencing, allocating, and freeing memory. We are instructed to write code using [Betty's style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki).

## Project Requirements:

1. All files compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
1. Compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
1. A README.md file required
1. No global variables
1. No more than 5 functions per file
1. Only standard library functions allowed: malloc, free, and exit
1. All prototypes should be placed inside the lists header file
1. Header files should be guarded
