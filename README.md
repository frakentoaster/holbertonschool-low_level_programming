# Computer Science Fundamentals in C.

This repo contains code from our low-level programming track at Holberton School. Many restraints are placed on the use of libraries. While challenging, it really pushed us to learn the inner working of many functions we often take advantage of.

## A Few Topics Covered:

1. Pointers
1. File Descriptors
1. Hash Tables
1. Recursion
1. Macros
1. Structures
1. Memory Allocation
1. Makefiles
1. Debugging
1. Many Algorithms
